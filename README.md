# BigDataProj
Given a dataset 'points' in numpy.array form
To perform dimensionality reduction, run X = DimensionReduce.dimRed(points, k) where k is an integer less than points' original dimension
To perform kmeans++ clustering, run c, clusters = kmeans.kmeansPP(points, k) where k is number of clusters.
